abstract="Correlation networks are increasingly being used in bioinformatics applications. For example, weighted gene co-expression network analysis is a systems biology method for describing the correlation patterns among genes across microarray samples. Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) can be used for finding clusters (modules) of highly correlated genes, for summarizing such clusters using the module eigengene or an intramodular hub gene, for relating modules to one another and to external sample traits (using eigengene network methodology), and for calculating module membership measures. Correlation networks facilitate network based gene screening methods that can be used to identify candidate biomarkers or therapeutic targets. These methods have been successfully applied in various biological contexts, e.g. cancer, mouse genetics, yeast genetics, and analysis of brain imaging data. While parts of the correlation network methodology have been described in separate publications, there is a need to provide a user-friendly, comprehensive, and consistent software implementation and an accompanying tutorial.",

The purpose of the study was to determine whether serum levels of d- and l-serine in patients with AD are altered as compared with normal controls. Serum levels of d- and l-serine in patients of AD and age- and gender-matched normal controls were determined using a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Serum levels of d-serine in the patients with AD were slightly (z=−1.77, p=0.078) lower than those of normal controls. In contrast, serum levels of l-serine in the patients were slightly (z=−1.73, p=0.083) higher than those of controls. In addition, the percentage (%) of d-serine in the total (l+d) serine in the patients was significantly (z=−2.36, p=0.018) lower than that of controls. The present study suggests that the reduced activity of serine racemase, an enzyme catalyzing the formation of d-serine from l-serine may play a role in the pathophysiology of AD."

abstract="Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by a wide loss of synapses and dendritic spines. Despite extensive efforts, the molecular mechanisms driving this detrimental alteration have not yet been determined. Among the factors potentially mediating this loss of neuronal connectivity, the contribution of Rho GTPases is of particular interest. This family of proteins is classically considered a key regulator of actin cytoskeleton remodeling and dendritic spine maintenance, but new insights into the complex dynamics of its regulation have recently determined how its signaling cascade is still largely unknown, both in physiological and pathological conditions. Here, we review the growing evidence supporting the potential involvement of Rho GTPases in spine loss, which is a unanimously recognized hallmark of early AD pathogenesis. We also discuss some new insights into Rho GTPase signaling framework that might explain several controversial results that have been published. The study of the connection between AD and Rho GTPases represents a quite unchartered avenue that holds therapeutic potential.",

abstract="The progress we have made in understanding Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis has led to the identification of several novel pathways and potential therapeutic targets. Rho GTPases have been implicated as critical components in AD pathogenesis, but their various functions and interactions make understanding their complex signaling challenging to study. Recent advancements in both the field of AD and Rho GTPase drug development provide novel tools for the elucidation of Rho GTPases as a viable target for AD. Herein, we summarize the fluctuating activity of Rho GTPases in various stages of AD pathogenesis and in several in vitro and in vivo AD models. We also review the current pharmacological tools such as NSAIDs, RhoA/ROCK, Rac1, and Cdc42 inhibitors used to target Rho GTPases and their use in AD-related studies. Finally, we summarize the behavioral modifications following Rho GTPase modulation in several AD mouse models. As key regulators of several AD-related signals, Rho GTPases have been studied as targets in AD. However, a consensus has yet to be reached regarding the stage at which targeting Rho GTPases would be the most beneficial. The studies discussed herein emphasize the critical role of Rho GTPases and the benefits of their modulation in AD.",

The synaptopathology of AD is known to involve both pre- and postsynaptic components. However, the status of rabphilin 3A (RPH3A), which interacts with the SNARE complex and regulates synaptic vesicle exocytosis and Ca2+-triggered neurotransmitter release, is at present unclear. In this study, we measured RPH3A and its ligand Rab3A as well as several SNARE proteins in postmortem neocortex of patients with AD, and found specific reductions of RPH3A immunoreactivity compared with aged controls. RPH3A loss correlated with dementia severity, cholinergic deafferentation, and increased β-amyloid (Aβ) concentrations. Furthermore, RPH3A expression is selectively downregulated in cultured neurons treated with Aβ25–35 peptides. Our data suggest that presynaptic SNARE dysfunction forms part of the synaptopathology of AD."

Changes in NMDAR subunit composition have been documented in brain disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and levodopa (L-DOPA)-induced dyskinesias (LIDs), where an increase of NMDAR GluN2A/GluN2B subunit ratio at striatal synapses has been observed. A therapeutic approach aimed at rebalancing NMDAR synaptic composition represents a valuable strategy for PD and LIDs. To this, the comprehension of the molecular mechanisms regulating the synaptic localization of different NMDAR subtypes is required. We have recently demonstrated that Rabphilin 3A (Rph3A) is a new binding partner of NMDARs containing the GluN2A subunit and that it plays a crucial function in the synaptic stabilization of these receptors. Considering that protein-protein interactions govern the synaptic retention of NMDARs, the purpose of this work was to analyse the role of Rph3A and Rph3A/NMDAR complex in PD and LIDs, and to modulate Rph3A/GluN2A interaction to counteract the aberrant motor behaviour associated to chronic L-DOPA administration. Thus, an array of biochemical, immunohistochemical and pharmacological tools together with electron microscopy were applied in this study. Here we found that Rph3A is localized at the striatal postsynaptic density where it interacts with GluN2A. Notably, Rph3A expression at the synapse and its interaction with GluN2A-containing NMDARs were increased in parkinsonian rats displaying a dyskinetic profile. Acute treatment of dyskinetic animals with a cell-permeable peptide able to interfere with Rph3A/GluN2A binding significantly reduced their abnormal motor behaviour. Altogether, our findings indicate that Rph3A activity is linked to the aberrant synaptic localization of GluN2A-expressing NMDARs characterizing LIDs. Thus, we suggest that Rph3A/GluN2A complex could represent an innovative therapeutic target for those pathological conditions where NMDAR composition is significantly altered."

ABSTRACT={Epidemiological studies have shown that both lipid metabolism disorder and mitochondrial dysfunction are correlated with the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs), including Parkinson’s disease (PD). Emerging evidence suggests that deposition of intracellular lipid droplets (LDs) participates in lipotoxicity and precedes neurodegeneration. Perilipin family members were recognized to facilitate LD movement and cellular signaling interactions. However, the direct interaction between Perilipin-regulated LD deposition and mitochondrial dysfunction in dopaminergic (DA) neurons remains obscure. Here, we demonstrate a novel type of lipid dysregulation involved in PD progression as evidenced by upregulated expression of Plin4 (a coating protein and regulator of LDs), and increased intracellular LD deposition that correlated with the loss of TH-ir (Tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive) neurons in the MPTP/p-induced PD model mouse mesencephalon. Further, in vitro experiments showed that inhibition of LD storage by downregulating Plin4 promoted survival of SH-SY5Y cells. Mechanistically, reduced LD storage restored autophagy, leading to alleviation of mitochondrial damage, which in turn promoted cell survival. Moreover, the parkin-poly-Ub-p62 pathway was involved in this Plin4/LD-induced inhibition of mitophagy. These findings were further confirmed in primary cultures of DA-nergic neurons, in which autophagy inhibitor treatment significantly countermanded the ameliorations conferred by Plin4 silencing. Collectively, these experiments demonstrate that a dysfunctional Plin4/LD/mitophagy axis is involved in PD pathology and suggest Plin4-LDs as a potential biomarker as well as therapeutic strategy for PD.}

abstract="During cell stress, the transcription and translation of immediate early genes are prioritized, while most other messenger RNAs (mRNAs) are stored away in stress granules or degraded in processing bodies (P-bodies). TIA-1 is an mRNA-binding protein that needs to translocate from the nucleus to seed the formation of stress granules in the cytoplasm. Because other stress granule components such as TDP-43, FUS, ATXN2, SMN, MAPT, HNRNPA2B1, and HNRNPA1 are crucial for the motor neuron diseases amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)/spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and for the frontotemporal dementia (FTD), here we studied mouse nervous tissue to identify mRNAs with selective dependence on Tia1 deletion. Transcriptome profiling with oligonucleotide microarrays in comparison of spinal cord and cerebellum, together with independent validation in quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR and immunoblots demonstrated several strong and consistent dysregulations. In agreement with previously reported TIA1 knock down effects, cell cycle and apoptosis regulators were affected markedly with expression changes up to +2-fold, exhibiting increased levels for Cdkn1a, Ccnf, and Tprkb vs. decreased levels for Bid and Inca1 transcripts. Novel and surprisingly strong expression alterations were detected for fat storage and membrane trafficking factors, with prominent +3-fold upregulations of Plin4, Wdfy1, Tbc1d24, and Pnpla2 vs. a −2.4-fold downregulation of Cntn4 transcript, encoding an axonal membrane adhesion factor with established haploinsufficiency. In comparison, subtle effects on the RNA processing machinery included up to 1.2-fold upregulations of Dcp1b and Tial1. The effect on lipid dynamics factors is noteworthy, since also the gene deletion of Tardbp (encoding TDP-43) and Atxn2 led to fat metabolism phenotypes in mouse. In conclusion, genetic ablation of the stress granule nucleator TIA-1 has a novel major effect on mRNAs encoding lipid homeostasis factors in the brain, similar to the fasting effect.",
