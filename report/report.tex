\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

Patients with neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD) share common physiological and symptomatic similarities, however the molecular pathways linking these diseases are incompletely understood. Recently, a comprehensive quantitative proteomic dataset of the human brain in patients with AD, PD, and AD/PD comorbidity has been publicly released. We will perform exploratory data analysis and modelling in order to identify if there are disease-specific differential gene expression patterns that are associated with AD and PD neuropathologies. We will then perform Weighted Correlation Network Analysis (WCNA) of the identified genes to assess if there coexpression relationships between subsets of these genes. Finally, using the PANTHER gene ontology classification system, we will assess whether these genes exhibit functional relationships. 



\section{Dataset}
\label{sec:dataset}

The dataset\cite{proteome} that we will be evaluating was obtained by performing Tandem Mass Tag (TMT) isobaric mass spectrometry on brain tissue obtained from individual human donors. Brain tissue samples were obtained from $40$ individual patient samples across two separate brain regions, the Frontal Cortex and the Anterior Cingulate Gyrus). The dataset obtained by using a factorial experimental design, where there are $5$ experimental batches, with two samples of each phenotype (Control Patient, Alzheimer’s Patient, Parkinson’s Patient, Alzheimer’s/Parkinson’s Patient) within each batch. For each batch, a control sample was generated by pooling fractions of all samples in order to generate a global internal standard (GIS) expression measure. Individual data entries are displayed as base-$10$ log-transformed ratios of the obtained peptide counts for the $ij$th sample covariate of interest and the $i$th covariate of the GIS standard. From the Frontal Cortex, $10,100$ unique protein groups were identified, while from the Anterior Cingulate Gyrus, $10,695$ protein groups were identified.

\section{Exploratory analysis and preprocessing}
\label{sec:expl-analys-prepr}

 In the initial portion of this project, we will assess data quality and phenotype and  inter-batch variability by box-plot visualization. We will then compare different normalization procedures such as loess, full-quantile, and upper-quantile when applied between samples. Next, we will apply PCA and MDS methods in order to determine if there is clustering of samples based on the disease phenotype.


\subsection{Data quality and Preprocessing}
\label{subsec:data-qual-vari}

We performed several quality control steps on the data-set before analysis. A large fraction of the gene rows contained batches that consisted of entirely NA or zero values that needed to be removed. We attribute these values to commonly reported issues of label-free mass spectrometry experiments that involve probe bias and reduced coverage of peptides. In order to preserve genes that contained peptide counts for all batches, we removed any gene that had NAs present in any batch. Next, we repeated the process by removing any gene that contained zeros, since these values would result in undefined log-transformed expression measures. In the Frontal Cortex, this process resulted in a final gene count of $6,004$ from an original dataset of $10,100$ genes. In the Anterior Cingulate Gyrus, this resulted in a final gene count of $6230$ genes. 

\subsection{Exploratory analysis}
\label{subsec:exploratory-analysis}

In order to assess our processed data, we visualized the distribution of all fold-change (FC) gene expression values for each patient sample across all disease traits (Ctl, AD, PD, and ADPD) (Fig.1A). Upon inspection of the plots, we noticed that all samples had FC gene expression values that were centered around zero, indicating that the experimental effects between batches were significantly reduced by normalizing against a GIS for each batch. However, for a fraction of patient samples, we still observed significant FC gene expression outliers. 

Next, we performed Principle Component Analysis (PCA) on the samples in both the Frontal Cortex and the Anterior Cingulate Gyrus (Fig.2A and B. A PCA plot of all disease traits did not indicate any clear separation of classes in both tissues. In order to simplify visualization, we then generated pairwise PCA plots between the Control samples and disease-state samples in both tissues (Fig.2C and D). In both tissue samples, we observed that clear separation of the Control and AD samples. Similarly, we observed separation of the Control and comorbid ADPD samples. However, when when we analyzed the Control and PD samples, we did not observe clear separation between the two traits.

We then quantitatively assessed the separation between the Control and disease-state samples by applying an Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to the PCA plots. 

\section{Linear modelling to identify differential expression}
\label{sec:line-modell-ident}

In order to identify differentially expressed genes between Control samples and disease-state samples, we utilized linear models. We  samples as covariates (with parameter coefficientsfor the control, AD, PD, and AD/PD samples) in order to determine the strength of association between each gene and the disease phenotypes. We used two separate linear modelling approaches. First, we considered the

\section{Weighted correlation network analysis}
\label{sec:weight-corr-netw}

 Using the candidate differentially expressed genes for the PD, AD, and PD/AD disease phenotypes, we will apply weighted correlation network analysis in order to determine if the candidate genes exhibit interesting coexpression patterns. First, using the available WGNA R-package\cite{Langfelder2008}, we will determine whether there are interesting coexpression clusterings between differentially expressed genes for each phenotype. Next, we will assess the clustering size/structure and compare these properties between phenotypes.

\section{Biological functions of differentially expressed genes}
\label{sec:biol-funct-diff}

Using the PANTHER gene ontology database, we identify the functional classifications of the differential expressed genes. We will perform this analysis between all phenotypes in order to comment on genes that may have unique biological roles related to PD, AD, and PD/AD disease states.


\subsection{PANTHER gene ontology database}
\label{subsec:panth-gene-ontol}

The PANTHER project, which we used to identify the biological functions of the differentially expressed genes, has the following purpose\cite{PANTHER}:\\

\begin{blockquote}
  The PANTHER (protein annotation through evolutionary relationship) classification system (\url{http://www.pantherdb.org/}{http://www.pantherdb.org/}) is a comprehensive system that combines gene function, ontology, pathways and statistical analysis tools that enable biologists to analyze large-scale, genome-wide data from sequencing, proteomics or gene expression experiments. The system is built with 82 complete genomes organized into gene families and subfamilies, and their evolutionary relationships are captured in phylogenetic trees, multiple sequence alignments and statistical models (hidden Markov models or HMMs). Genes are classified according to their function in several different ways: families and subfamilies are annotated with ontology terms (Gene Ontology (GO) and PANTHER protein class), and sequences are assigned to PANTHER pathways.
